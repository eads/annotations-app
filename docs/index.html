  <p>hospitals, the school systems, no, we're not doing that. We have learned lessons of that we are not good at that. Also, it is not our responsibility. We will do basic stabilization. When it comes to schools, if the local counsel says there are five schools in the area and they have been wired with explosives devices, will you please help? <span class='highlight'>Yes, that is something we will do. If they need desks, chairs, chalkboards, we can find contractors from the local area to do that. I will give you an example.</span>

<p> We are working with local people from the area and I met them. Not long ago, they were living under ISIS and now they are working hard to try to restore life to their community. <span class='highlight'>They have told us about a number of schools that actually are wired to explode, so we are now helping miners in the area to clear the schools</span>
. About five have already been finished. We will do all we can to have as many schools ready for the opening of the school year on September 15.</p>

<p>, teachers, this is the responsibility of the syrian on the ground and iraq is on the ground. Not us. In Raqqa we have 400 google infrastructure sites we have identified — we have identified for the day after, 100 of them are really priority. We are also getting conservations from our coalition, we announced we have the conference — had the conference two weeks ago and we had funding mechanisms focused on <span class='highlight'>syria</span>
. One the recovery trust fund mow which is now able to operate in the area. Second, the donor consortium, which is project specific as we identify those projects for stabilization. Then we met with contractors — match with contribute. It is ongoing but it will take time. It will be a difficult battle. <span class='highlight'>45% of the city is cleared in two months</span>

<p>I will go a little faster with some of these. <span class='highlight'>The area known as the milia paredes valley — middle euphrates valley, as leaders saw the writing on the wall, they tried to flee before our sources surrounded raqqa. They fled the small towns in the area of the freddie's river. — euphrates river. Very small areas in what we call the middle valley.</span>

<p>And I would say any ISIS leaders in the small town have a good life insurance policy because unlike when they are living in what these guys used to do, they lived in apartment buildings with hundreds of people in the</p>
<p>structure, which obviously makes it impossible for us to target them, because we will not target a civilian structure. When they live in small towns and villages, not only is it different for them, this is not the glamorous caliphate they expected to find. It is also easier for us to find them. <span class='highlight'>In the last few weeks, I think our dod announced yesterday, about 13 key leaders and associates have been targeted and eliminated in the area and it will continue.</span>

<p> This area of the country also cannot emphasize enough, extremely complex. That is why d confliction arrangements with the russians will be increasingly important as we operate in this area. It is a complex battle space, the arrangements are important and that is why we are so focused on that. Number three, the yellow gumball, this is a garrison. We are training a force there to fight ISIS in the middle valley, because the force we are training there are from that area and the training continues. It is an important mission in terms of the overall counter ISIS campaign. <span class='highlight'>This area also became fairly tense in the end of June, with some, I do not know if I would call it misunderstandings, some perhaps misunderstandings from forces that led to airstrikes.</span>

<p>Since then, the situation has calmed down and we have worked on an arrangement that has been working well and we will make sure those stay in place. It is an important piece of syria, connected with article ally jordan and also iraq. We want to make sure that ISIS cannot fill up space in this area, because it iorporates critical road networks which I will talk about briefly when I discuss iraq. The fourth yellow gumball, that is the southwest. It is very important because, the little separate from the counter ISIS campaign, but it is</p>
<p>an enabler for trying to remove the red blocked which is ISIS. This is a cell for ISIS near the number four. <span class='highlight'>They are an ISIS affiliate</span>

<p> When they come in and capture a village like they did there, they capture locals, they do beheadings, and they terrorize the local population. We are determined to remove that sell from the southwest — cell from the southwest. We worked with the — who were a critical driver of the process, are critical ally jordan. And a cease-fire in the southwest with jordan and Russia. The cease-fire was concluded on July 9. It was finalized in hamburg between President Trump and president Putin. It went into effect on July 11, so we are into the third week now. And the results have been quite promising so far.</p>
<p>the fighting has largely stopped. There is a couple reasons for this, unlike other cease-fires, this cease-fire was the result of months of negotiation with the geraniums who know the terrain, and the russians that were representing effectively the syrian regime. Painstaking negotiations, meter by meter, throughout the southwest and throughout the city. Everybody understood where they could go and where they could not go. The map was initialed by all three parties and the cease-fire went into effect on July 11.</p>

<p> We now see civilians returning to the area, which is promising. Beginning to see the landmines being removed as the fighting has stopped. We are working hard to make sure it remains in effect and so far it is promising. If you look at the last six months in syria and you look at the data that is put out by the u.n., it is interesting to look at that data in terms of idp's</p>
<p>and refugee flows. Um, this is from <span class='highlight'>unhcr</span>
</p>
<p>[DM2: The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), also known as the UN Refugee Agency, is a United Nations programme mandated to protect and support refugees at the request of a government or the UN itself and assists in their voluntary repatriation, local integration or resettlement to a third country.]</p>
<p>, in the last six months of the calendar year about 400,000 idp's have returned to their homes. <span class='highlight'>It is a statistic you normally do not see in six months. 31,000 syrian refugees, those that fled outside of syria, have also returned to their homes in the first six months of the year.</span>

<p>The reverse of the migrant refugee outflow, it is an important indicator and is something we want to continue. In the interest of our critical partners and in our interest, but fairly jordan, lebanon and turkey. And of course our partners in Europe. Backup on syria writ large, the secretary spoke about this. If you think about the two phases in syria, right now this is phase one. We want to defeat ISIS. We have to defeat ISIS, because they are trying to plan major attacks against us and our</p>
<p>partners. So as long as ISIS is holding territory, pretending to hold this caliphate with people under their domain, the long-term political settlement in syria will be out of reach. Our first priority is to protect our homeland. Number one, defeat ISIS. In parallel with phase one, we want to de-escalate violence in syria through a combination of de-escalation, d confliction arrangements, and de-escalation such as the cease-fire we have reached in the west. We are in phase one, we are d escalating the situation. And we have imported talks about a constitutional process in the future, internationally monitored elections in which the syrians can vote. That is a condition in the u.n. Resolution. We are determined getting to that point — <span class='highlight'>in getting to that</span>
 point. The secretary discussed</p>

<p>defeating ISIS, get arrangements in place, quiet down the operations, and set of conditions for political settlement of the civil war. At the end of the process, we cannot put a timeline on it, but at the end of the process we do not envision assad being in control of syria from damascus. Whether that is through a constitutional process or election or a combination, that is important and some people ask, why do you say that? It is reality.

<p>, it is probably multiples of that, and to the international community will not come to the aid of syria until there is a horizon that can lead to a credible transition in damascus. That is the reality. So we are working through the two-phase structure and we are committed to the roadmap outlined in the u.n. Security resolution.</p>
<p>let me jump over to iraq. I will start with the yellow gumball number five. Number five is to the west of Tel Afar. The battle muzzle has — Mosul has not completed, but since the battle completed — again, the west glamorous phase of stabilization and support is underway. It is important, because the reason we brought those 70 countries here in March was to make sure we have the resources necessary for the post ISIS phase in Mosul. In total, we saw 940,000. The skill of Mosul — scale of Mosul is not even comparable to Raqqa. Mosul is a city of about 1.5 million people. So total, 940,000 people were displaced from the fighting.</p>
<p>most important, all of them received aid. This is almost unprecedented in terms of humanitarian response. All of them received aid and assistance and it is because of the planning that went into the humanitarian response plan together with the military plane. Of the $2 billion raised in March, about $500 million from the U.S., the ratio we mentioned, and we try to make sure it is about 3-4-1. When it comes to stabilization and humanitarian response, it is a ratio we are looking to grow over the coming weeks. Currently in mosul, about 338,000 people remain displaced. We are working very hard now in west mosul, when I say we I mean the government of iraq, our coalition, the united nations and the people of the province, on stabilization projects.</p>
<p>in west mosul where the damage is more extensive, engineers, part of the program for stabilization funded in part by the coalition, they have assessed about 200 schools, political substations, sewage plans, hospitals, police stations, demining, setting of the conditions for people to return. The model is east mosul where the battle ended six months ago. We already have 350,000 children back in school. The population has really returned. If you talk to people who've walked the streets, they come back with that, with that story seeing it with their own eyes. A lot of problems to see the least, but — say the least, but people are returning. Long-term reconstruction, we are focused on the immediate stabilization so long-term reconstruction is not, again, do not look to the U.S. To fit the bill for long-term reconstruction.</p>
<p>it is an international problem, ISIS is a challenge for the entire world. That is why we built a coalition of 74 partners, one of the largest in history. And I give great credit to the iraqi government because they are looking to fund, how to fund long-term reconstruction needs. They have a standby arrangement with the imf and they passed a bill through parliament, difficult stuff that is not get much attention but it pays dividends down the road. It will release another $1 billion. And the iraqi government bailed their world vision to the bank about reforms they are committed to to help fuel their international financing of the reconstruction. And kuwait, his highness has announced that they will announce — hold a conference for iraq in the early part of next year. Those are obviously efforts that we will support. When it comes to the next phase of the ISIS campaign, that will probably be the next battle in t elefar. It will probably happen about the time the choosing of the government in iraq. There are about 40,000 civilians. Somewhat similar to Raqqa, a little bit smaller, but it will be difficult. It has been a hub for ISIS, it has been the home for many of their leaders. It has been a place where terrible atrocities were committed not against just Shiite Muslims, but others in this terrible fulcrum of ISIS atrocities. Many of them happened here. It will be very hard. They iraqis are committed to liberating the people and we are committed to supporting them at a time of their choosing. Gumball number six, this is — and we estimate about 1000 fighters from ISIS there. The numbers are sometimes hard to go by. About 50,000 civilians in the</p>
<p>pocket of territory, about 50,000-80,000 if you look at the environment. It will be a complex operation, similar to mosul it will involve cooperation between the kurds, iraqi secured forces, and forces local to the area. Secretary tillerson spoke over the last few days with the prime minister and the president of the credit stand region about the next steps and important issues that iraq is confronting. Quickly, number seven, that is al-quiem, also a heartland devices. We will support forces as they clear that and restore sovereignty to their border with security forces. We are preparing for that. And number eight, 8 and 9 are important because this is the phase after ISIS. Number 8, the main border crossing between iraq and jordan.</p>
<p>it is a very important commerce route, very important for iraq, the government of iraq and also anbar province. The iraqis have been working to set conditions to open the highway and we hope it can happen fairly soon. And give them great credit for what they are putting in place. To get that open, the billion dollar a month commerce route, it is important for the future of the region and obviously something we are supporting both governments, encouraging them to move forward on that. 9, the crossing with the saudi arabia which has been closed since 1990. Multiple U.S. Administrations have encouraged the opening between iraq and saudi arabia but doors have remained closed. We achieved a breakthrough, the iraqis and saudis, a breakthrough that has led</p>
<p>to exchanges of key ministers and talking about opening the border crossing for the first time since 1990. It is a critical commerce route and you can kind of see the post ISIS situation come into shape there. It is important, that is why I wanted to include 9 on the map. Beyond iraq and syria, why is it important? This is the caliphate, been through so many fighters to join ISIS and it is what makes them a global network. They try to fund ISIS from the resources they get around iraq and syria. We have targeted and degraded their ability to resource themselves and their ability to get foreign fighters into syria, almost impossible for them to do that now. We are working to sever all their financial connections. I thought it would highlight, finally, a way that we work throughout the inter-agency, which sometimes does not get much attention. The treasury department has a</p>
<p>very robust program for finding who in the organization of ISIS is the leader, who is handling money, and making sure we designate those people so they can never have any access to the financial system internationally, and some of her colleagues recently confirmed officials at the treasury department have done a great job in this. It is important, because when you see a list of designees from ISIS, that means they will never have access to the financial system. We know their finances are frozen. A lot of these guys probably never expect to have access to the system, but if you are in ISIS and your name shows up on a treasury designation list, you are not just being targeted by the treasury department. That is why it is a close correlation between announcing a designee and eliminating these people from the battlefield. Since June of this year, three critical financial facilitators</p>
<p>from ISIS have been killed in air strikes in the euphrates valley area. I think you are all fairly familiar with what we are doing, counter messaging and working with partners in the area. I was here a couple weeks ago, so I will not go to deeply into that. I will conclude with the map of the caliphate which is rapidly shrinking. 30% of their territorial losses in the last few months alone. That is due to changes we have made in the campaign and we will continue to accelerate the pressure on ISIS until the entire organization collapses and they cannot hold any physical territories from which they can threaten us. With that, I think I have time for a few questions.</p>
<p>>> Thank you. Just one question, you said that the U.S. Will not participate in reconstruction, you will be engaged in just stabilizing the area, so what does that mean for</p>
<p>your partnership with the kurds? Does that mean the partnership is about to end, because it seems to me that most of the areas predominantly kurdish have been stabilized?</p>
<p>Brett: Let me be clear. In terms of our military partnerships, our training, the iraqi government has a budget of about $10 million and a look at the U.S. To be the primary supplier, they are buying art equipment. It is something we intend to continue. The training relationship, and coronation with the government of iraq, is something that is historic and we intend to continue. When it comes to long-term reconstruction of the areas, that is not something that the U.S. Can do on its own. That is why we have built an international coalition of 74 members to help. That is why the world bank,</p>
<p>international monetary fund and other international financial institutions, it is important for them to be engaged. Critically important for the future of iraq for the gcc to be engaged. That is why we are encouraged by the conference that they will host in kuwait. We recognize our role, but it is not the U.S. Alone because ISIS is a threat to the whole world.</p>
<p>>> Just a few questions. First of all, can you tell us whether the overall deterioration in russian relations has had any impact on your coordination? I know the secretary said you are still working on it. And you said you have the cease-fire line in the south, but arrangements in other areas. Are there any other areas where it might shift to more of an agreement, or is it something that you see after raqqa is finished? And I have one other question.</p>
<p>brett: Good question. So far we have not seen an effect on our engagement with the russians when it comes to syria, most of those engagements are professional military to military engagements. Literally, mn talking with — airmen talking with airmen to avoid accidents. The southwest, that is the one area where we have reached a political agreement about a cease-fire. With that agreement, it is not just a line with the cease-fire between the two sides, it also talks about political arrangements in the area, making sure opposition arrangements can remain intact, re-freezing everything in place. It is a detailed arrangement. It is an actual cease-fire with the russians, that is the only part of the country we have reached an arrangement. If there are other opportunities</p>
<p>to build on those talks, other opportunities to reach those types of arrangements to help settle down syria, we are very much open to that. So obviously that is something we will speak with the russians about, but so far the southwest is really the only place we have locked in place the cease-fire.</p>
<p>>> There have been reports that they have stopped funding for the program to fund the syrian opposition fighting assad. You said it was frozen in place, I am wondering what is happening to the people? Are they protected in the arrangement if you are no longer supporting them?</p>
<p>Brett: I can just say the agreement we reached with Russia has a very detailed cease-fire line. The russians have put their monitors on the northern side, to help monitor regime violations. So far the fighting has stopped. As we begin to see people return to their homes, we see the</p>
<p>increase of humanitarian aid and that is when you can become a self-sustaining cycle.</p>
<p>>> As part of the post ISIS political system, all of this fighting, for the kurds the key issue is the independence referendum. What is your position on the? Are the iraqi elections a factor in consideration?</p>
<p>Brett: I think we have spoken to this, we do not believe the referendum is a good idea. It is ill-timed, not well prepared. There are critical engagements against ISIS that have to take place with the full cooperation from iraqi security forces and it could have catastrophic consequences, so obviously we are in detailed discussions with iraqi leaders over this and that is one reason why secretary tillerson made important calls over the last few days.</p>
<p>>> It is it a question of timing or the referendum?</p>
<p>Brett: The kurdish authorities say they want to hold it on September 25, it is something the U.S. Government is firmly opposed to.</p>
<p>>> When you talk about the numbers left in iraq and syria, how many of the ones that have left the area do you think are dead, versus who fled the region? Where do you see the book of them going, more to libya or more to europe? And how do you think one to consider ISIS kind of defeated in raqqa and iraq, what is the benchmark for that and how do you see the next kind of iteration of the coalition in terms of what you would consider ISIS defeated?</p>
<p>Brett: Great question. Look, until the, until we — we work closely with turkey to seal</p>
<p>the border, whether it is east of the afraid is river — east of the euphrates river, or on the west side where they have liberated two border crossings and also took the spiritual town, the spiritual kind of — in ISIS propaganda, they thought it would happen there, so calling for people all around the world. They actually changed it. In any event, it was an important operation and since the border has been sealed ISIS fighters are not getting in, and also not getting out. I cannot guarantee that they cannot find a smuggling route, but they are coming by the thousands, at least 90%. And we are not fighting ISIS fighters able to leave syria. Not long ago, they would plan a terrorist attack in raqqa, they would train a unit, they would</p>
<p>then infiltrate out, they would go conduct an attack such as in paris or brussels. They were developing in that capacity. They cannot do that anymore. What are we doing? We're building a database of who these people are. As we find names on the battlefield and we have a very robust, through our coalition, intelligence gathering. We call it sensitive site exploitation, we find a cell phone, address book, we share names with host nations. If it is a french name we share it with french authorities. We have a database of 19,000 names, drawn out on interpol databases, so that any member has access to the database of that if there is somebody that fox in syria — fought in syria and has gotten out, and a routine search or traffic stop, they can actually be identified.</p>
<p>the next phase of the coalition is obviously a little less emphasis on the ground operations in iraq and syria because those ultimately will conclude, it is information sharing, that is the critical enabler to protect our homeland. And that is one coalition — reason why the coalition is strong and continues to grow. We just added 4 african countries to the coalition because this is a global network, and as we succeed against these networks, more countries want to join and be part of this. Yes?</p>
<p>>> I have a few questions. First of all, as you know, U.S. Special forces general thompson said it will rebrand itself to address turkish concerns—</p>
<p>future, and he added that is how mccook was able to be in the conversation. They are rebranding themselves. And do you plan on going into — once raqqa is cleared? And [indiscernible] once everything is settled down?</p>
<p>Brett: Ok, general thomas has done an incredible job from day one of the campaign, going all the way back to the battles for —. And you might remember kobani surrounded by ISIS fighters, had it fallen the whole border would've gone to ISIS. Some of our friends in iraq, kurdish friends that actually put us in touch with kurdish fighters in kobani at the time to develop contacts and get military equipment to them. Then we worked with turkey as part of this.</p>
<p>we wanted to open a corridor to turn the tide of the battle. It was a historic moment. Over the course of the battle, we killed 6000 ISIS fighters, the first time they lost a battle and it was really a turning point. After that, when we met fighters from kobani, and we said, how we going to really take the fight to ISIS in the other areas. We have to recruit arabs into the force. You have to have an umbrella that embraces the arab component with the key principles in syria, as areas are liberated they should return to the local people from those areas. That is first and foremost. We had to have in him will that would bring in — an ambulance that would bring in as many people as possible. All these guys working together as a cohesive force, not working together as different units, which is not effective. So general thomas was a part of that.</p>
<p>it has been a very effective. So all returning classes are full, full of Christians, areas, people who want to liberate accounts. Overall I think it has been successful. Dezor is on the map, it is to the northwest of the yellow gumball number two. And what makes it complicated is it is a city with an air filled in which it syrian army forces have been trying to seize for the last two years. They have thousands of their own fighters in their. They are surrounded by ISIS. And the syrian army forces are determined to break the siege. Look at what the russians, the russian general gave a briefing talking about the operation a few weeks ago. They are 140 kilometers away. They have some ways to go. I think it is a decent assumption that over time they</p>
<p>will probably succeed in that mission, but how much further they go from there will remain to be seen and we will be in discussions with the russians on the. — on that.</p>
<p>>> Thank you. After ISIS is defeated, do you think that kurdistan will be the U.S. Strategy —?</p>
<p>Brett: So, our strategic ally, our friends in iraq, we support the government of iraq, we support a unified federal iraq that is strong and prosperous and is at peace with itself and neighbors. Obviously, we have deep relations in the region. And working with all the kurdish parties, that is something that goes back decades and it is something a will continue. We will also continue working through the government of iraq within the iraqi constitutional</p>
<p>system to support a unified in federal iraq.</p>
<p>>> Couple of questions. First, have you sorted out differences with turkey regarding last week's —, there was a statement from the state department and in the panel you kept mentioning idlib as a safe haven for al qaeda. It is not on the map, but when you are done with the points on the map, do you have plans for idlib? And another question, regarding iraq. As far as I know, when there was a problem about the turkish president in pocket shot — in — you brokered a deal with opera and baghdad — ankara and baghdad and the condition was it would be liberated. Can you confirm that the turkish president is coming to an end</p>
<p>with the turkish troops in the region?</p>
<p>Brett: A lot of complex questions there. [laughter] brett: Yes, so I did a 90 minute panel and about 30 seconds of the panel got attention, very badly mischaracterized and I think we have spoken to this. And I mentioned, we have worked closely with turkey to seal the border. I mentioned in the battle combine, working with the turks to open up the corridor. All these things are important. At the same time, this problem of foreign fighters is a problem for all of us. 40,000 foreign fighters that came to join ISIS came from all around the world, they came through turkey, and it is a problem. Not just for tuey, but also for the source countries. The tunisians, saudis, have to</p>

Richards/Getty Images<br><br>&gt;&gt; Yes, to answer your question, we are still restricted that line of sight or an observer in radio communications with the pilot. You can kind of tear it out further if you have someone a can observe the uav and communicate back to the pilot. That&#39;s how we&#39;re doing it currently. I think that will involve as people become more comfortable with the safety aspects with using these types of tools.<br><br>&gt;&gt; Lot going on. Did you want to add anything?<br><br>&gt;&gt; I would add, the faa weather cams all through the state of alaska, being a pilot, I did this numerous times. If you are out in western alaska and you need to see what is going back into anchorage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">that it &mdash; that type of example exists all across the country. Whether it&#39;s street cams, recreational cams. Being able to learn those &mdash; being able to leverage those different data streams is an option that we need to explore. We&#39;re talking about what we have and what we use. We need to leverage those investments. That is the first place. Another place is within some of the federal agencies, especially in dod, department of army have smartphone devices. Smartphone software that allows data sharing rapidly. Right now it is android-based. It is not on iphone, but other types of phones. That&#39;s another example of ways that we can start managing technology better and building off each other&#39;s investment.<br><br>Senator murkowski: Thank you. I&#39;m going to have to go to the floor. We got a vote coming up quickly. I&#39;ll ask Senator cantwell to</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">close out the hearing and give you all my appreciation. Know that we want to work with you as we address these issues of fire management and how we deal with our wildfires around the nation. Thank you.<br><br>&gt;&gt; Thank you. Mr. Rice, I want to follow up &mdash; as director of office of wild land fire and your comments just now about use of technologies out there. I&#39;m aware of this U.S.A. Today article by robert will about U.S. Wildlife service presented &mdash; I&#39;m reading from article, presented second annual national fire safety award to bart wry who was &mdash; he helped direct a lost firefighter to safety during a prescribed fire. Rice suggested to fire crew on foot to carry gps transmitter collars like those worn by hunting dogs so that up to ten resources can be tracked</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">realtime by a burn boss on a single hand receiver device. If this is available today and what was just said about the drones, why not combine these technologies today to give firefighters more safety and security as they deal just these unbelievable conditions that can change so quickly?<br><br>&gt;&gt; Senator, it&#39;s a good idea. When secretary zinke came on board, we walked him through their operations and how we have incident command system, one of the first things that he said to me was, figure out how to keep track of our firefighters in a better way. It&#39;s something we&#39;re looking at. This references your earlier question. We are supportive of looking at it. We don&#39;t know what that right tool is yet. With any number of tens of thousands of firefighters that can be out in the field during a fire season, we want to have the</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">right solution. That&#39;s plug and play for anybody that shows up on a fire. Just like the nomax that shows up. We want the technology to be interoperable.<br><br>Senator cantrell: Given the fire map and where we are, it is just so scary. Now I can see that it&#39;s further into eastern Washington and then the previous map that was out a few months ago. Few years ago, people said to us, you&#39;re going to be at the epicenter. Boy, were we. I&#39;m just saying with this level of the west under these conditions, why not &mdash; if it&#39;s so easy to go get some now, why not let the flexibility and the suggestion for this fire season be there? All I&#39;m saying is, the reason I&#39;m coming back to you on this, is your first answer, it&#39;s kind</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">of, we&#39;re going to look at it and see what we can do. These as you said, are toolses that we can put in place today. You can say that voluntarily we give the ok for the these to be used. In this case, a U.S. Fish and wildlife service individual received an award for the innovation of it. I would just say that the reason I&#39;m working with Senator gardner, I came to the Senate shortly after the storm king fire that killed so many people. Then we have the 30-mile fire which killed several individuals in our state. To have a loss in life two years ago, it&#39;s just a reminder that these conditions can get out of control so quickly. If we can put the firefighters, many of them are young, in contact with someone who has</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">better visibility, I think it would be so helpful to us. Also helpful in attacking the hot spots of the fire as well. Knowing when we can pull back or using other resources. What about right now just moving forward on voluntary basis to might sure that&#39;s clear to people. If they wish to, they can?<br><br>&gt;&gt; Senator, it is being used. I apologize for not being clear. We do have folks in fish and wildlife service in the national park service, in the bureau of land management that are using this technology. We&#39;re learning from that. We are looking at different ways we can apply it across the enterprise. That doesn&#39;t preclude our staff from using them.<br><br>Senator cantwell: Anybody can use them now. We can use them in the northwest if we wanted to?<br><br>&gt;&gt; The staff that are local will work through their local office. This leads to a broader question, at the department</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">level, we are empowering our line officers to make decisions in the field. In order to do that &mdash;<br><br>Senator cantwell: It got so bad, we called out the national guard. We were taking volunteers from &mdash; we had not done that in our state in a long time. I know Ms. Christiansen worked on that before. Listen, northwest loves technology and it loves to keep pushing the envelope. Don&#39;t hold us back to getting solutions in the marketplace this summer, if we can. Thank you.<br><br>Senator king. Senator king: I&#39;m all set. I wanted to thank the witnesses. Thank you for your work. Look forward to continuing to work on this problem with you. Appreciate it.<br><br>&gt;&gt; Senator cortez masto?<br><br>Senator cortez masto: I would also like to thank all witness and chair for having this hearing so timely. As we said at the beginning we</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">used up 50% of our resources. This map says it all. We have to keep ahead of this changing conditions which are giving us more volatile, more territory, more really economic and human loss to our nation that we need to deal with. Thank you all for your innovative idea. We&#39;re adjourned.

Visit ncicap.org]<br><br>&gt;&gt; Starting in about 10 minutes on C-SPAN, we will be hearing from rick mcgurk, the special envoy for the global coalition to counter ISIS.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">he will be presenting at the state department and we will be here live as soon as his remarks begin. Until then, a conversation from today&#39;s &quot;washington journal.&quot; dinesh d&#39;souza stopping in today as he is discussing his book b &nbsp;the big lie: Exposing the nazi roots of the American left. &quot; who will get to the book in a few minutes. First your reaction to the grand jury that has been convened here. Subpoenas have been issued related to the meeting between the president sun and the russian lawyer. What is your reaction?<br><br>Guest: It is a little bit of the frankenstein-rosenstein creation. The reason is not because there is necessarily any incriminating evidence. I do not object to looking at it. Having been in D.C. Since the</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">1980&#39;s, the independent counsel is tasked with a mission. If they say there is nothing there, and a sense he fails. He views his success is getting somebody, locking them up. There is a logic here that is not &mdash; that makes the whole process not necessarily a search for truth, but a way to vindicate the process.<br><br>Host: Do have concerns with this special counsel? Can he conduct a special investigation?<br><br>Guest: Indications, and I admit that at this level I am a spectator of events, it looks like he is stocking his team with those hostile to Trump. That is not inherently bad. I think it May well be that when you combine ideology with the inherent logic of a special prosecutor&#39;s agenda it becomes a stacked process.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">host: Do think the process is more stacked when we see bills introduced in the Senate to shield the special counsel from being fired?<br><br>Guest: Yes. I think when the process gets going it is harder to stop. It looks like you are trying to cover something up and have something to hide. I have been through this judicial process myself for exceeding the campaign finance law. What happened is I gave $20,000 over the campaign finance limit to a friend of mine running for U.S. Senate. It seems strange to say that I was naive about campaign finance. I could have given to a pac, but I gave to two of my friends and reimburse them. The government comes to you and says we will charge you with</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">three things which carry five years in prison. If you plead guilty now we will drop to of the charges. The problem is whether or not you are guilty you have strong incentive to go along and plead to something even if you didn&#39;t do it. In my case it was more the prosecution issue. I&#39;ve seen the process work. It is not necessarily a search for truth and justice measured for proportionality. Victory is measured by what they can get out of it.<br><br>Host: In your case, what did you get convicted of?<br><br>Guest: I got a series of analgesics, the most serious was eight months in overnight confinement in a federal confinement center, I got a fine, five years of probation, and it makes you a lifelong felon. Ordinarily I would say, alrig</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ht, but when we looked at it no American had been prosecuted or locked up for doing it.<br><br>Host: Do you think your previous work was the reason why there was a special interest in you?<br><br>Guest: I think so. Once I really stay 2016 movie about Obama, the attacks on the movie appeared regularly on the website on his personal website. Shortly after the fbi comes calling.<br><br>Host: The latest book, &quot;the big lie,&quot; what is the story of this book?<br><br>Guest: The meta-story, the way that left is looking at child.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">since Trump&#39;s election the big card is not the race card, it is the fascism card. The idea that Trump is a fascist. Trump is sort of hitler 1933. A demagogue promising to make germany great again. This is not just rhetoric. Some rhetoric called reagan and bush a fascist. This is saying that even though he won an election he is illegitimate. Tactics that would be unacceptable, let&#39;s get the electors to change their votes, let&#39;s not go to the inauguration, let&#39;s mount a coup against child, let&#39;s have protesters block speakers from campus &mdash; this would be normally unacceptable. But the people that think this is like fighting hitler in the 30&#39;s, anything is justified by any means necessary.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">host: Can you define fascism and nazi is him?<br><br>Guest: Fascism and naziism is not the same. Hitler rarely called himself a fascist. Mussolini, the quintessential fascist never identified with hitler&#39;s national socialism. Fascism is the doctrine of a centralized state, a powerful centralized state running the economy and your life. Nazism is fascism plus anti-semitism. Fascism with a deep vein of racism and anti-semitism.<br><br>Host: We are taking your calls as we discussed this book and recent events. Dinesh d&#39;souza with us for the next 35 minutes. Phone lines are open. Republicans, (202) 748-8001.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Democrats, (202) 748-8000. Independents, (202) 748-8002. Clearwater, florida, robert on the line for Democrats.<br><br>Caller: I am retired military. I am appalled at this gentleman. I watched him many times on his favorite channel, fox on American news all the time. For him to say that the left spews hatred, I served 24 years I did not see that many in the military. For him to get on television and continue to make money off of the backs of the lies that he spews, especially on the</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">honorable man Barack Obama, and continue to support this liar in chief we have in office that put his whole career off of denigrating that honorable man. He is the one that has created havoc on our country with his lies, racism, with all of the separatist stuff he is doing. You know what, Mr. Dinesh?<br><br>You do the same thing. Host: That is your point, let&#39;s let dinesh d&#39;souza respond.<br><br>Guest: This is an example of how our political debate tends to break down a little bit. I wrote about Obama and made a movie about Obama. In the movie I went to hawaii, kenya, indonesia. I was at the Obama family compound, I interviewed Obama&#39;s brother. I wanted to expose thatObama</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">was not a traditional civil rights guy. His perspective was anti-colonial, shaped by an international view of the world. This is in Obama&#39;s own book. There was a hypocrisy to Obama. He was demanding of Americans we make sacrifices for each other. I said, here is Obama&#39;s own rather living in a slum in nairobi. Living in a hut where you stretch your arms and you touch the walls. There is something odd chanting &quot;we are our brother&#39;s keeper&quot; and here is his own brother and he hasn&#39;t helped him. Obama and Trump are opposites pursuing a different agenda.<br><br>Host: You said playing the nazi card stems from the election of Donald Trump.</span></p></body></html>
